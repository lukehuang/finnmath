finnMath is a free software library for the JVM which provides or will provide implementations for fractions, 
complex numbers, matrices and vectors and their arithmetics based on BigInteger and BigDecimal so that this 
library is not prone to buffer overflows and big rounding errors. The great Commons Math uses primitives 
so if you want to achieve best performance then please choose Commons Math instead.

What finnMath will provide:
* Implementations for matrices and vectors
* Implementations for fractions and complex numbers
* A pseudo random generator for all these implementations
* A square root calculator for BigInteger and BigDecimal based on Heron's method
* Determinant calculation based on the Leibniz formula and the rule of Sarrus

What finnMath will not provide:
* Solver for equations
* Matrix decomposition, reduction or factorization
* Polynomials

finnMath is written in Java and uses Maven as its build automation tool so it should interoperate seamlessly with 
other JVM technologies. Dependencies are big-math, Guava, Commons Lang and SLF4J and for tests AssertJ and JUnit.

## Implementation details
* Java 8
* All types are immutable.
* The matrices are based on ImmutableTable from Guava.
* The vectors are based on ImmutableMap from Guava.
* All leaf classes are final.
* Useful hashCode, equals and toString methods
* Builders for vectors and matrices
* Early failing with meaningful messages
* Logging facade instead of a hard dependency on a specific logging framework

## Information
* Maven site: https://ltennstedt.github.io/finnmath/index.html

finnMath is open source and free software and is licensed under the permissive Apache License.

finnMath is still in a very early state and a work in progress.

## Building

#### Prerequisites
* JDK
* Maven
* Git (optional)
#
    git clone https://github.com/ltennstedt/finnmath.git
    cd finnmath
    mvn install

This will clone the remote Git repository, build finnmath and install it into your local Maven repository.

## Developing

The code formatting follows loosely the Google Java style guide found here on GitHub.    

#### Why finnMath?
I searched for a mathematical library for another project which should be based on BigInteger and BigDecimal instead 
of primitives and I could not find one.

#### Why BigInteger or BigDecimal?
Both are protected against buffer overflows and BigDecimal is by far less prone to big rounding errors. In addition, 
you are able to control the rounding behaviour and the scale in the case of BigDecimal. The downsides of using them 
are the impact on the runtime speed, the higher memory consumption and the cumbersome syntax. 

#### Why AssertJ?
I find its assertions more readable in comparison to JUnit and Hamcrest and the fluent assertions are more IDE 
friendly.

#### Why the move from Gradle to Maven?
Gradle is a wonderful tool and I think that it will conquer the throne of build automation tools for the JVM in the 
near future. Its DSL is less verbose than Maven's XML approach and thanks to Groovy customizing all the tasks involved in 
the build process is very comfortable. So why I moved away from it? I have noticed at work that I need more expertise 
regarding Maven and a standard Java library project is by far the most suitable candidate for a Maven project because 
of its very standardized structure and workflow. Maven is very strict in terms of its build lifecycle, supports 
multi-project setups worse than Gradle and mixing languages is very ugly. Maven performs best when it manages a 
project which is a Maven project through and through. If you want to do things which are not covered by Maven's 
lifecycle very well, go for a multi-module or mixed-languages project, need custom tasks or choose Groovy or Kotlin as
a programming language, Gradle is indeed very hard to beat. Maven provides you with a declarative and uniform way to 
describe a build and it does it very well and the IDE support is outstanding. The flexibility and power of Gradle is 
not needed for a standard Java project like this one.
